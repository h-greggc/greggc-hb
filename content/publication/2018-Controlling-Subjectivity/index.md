abstract: This paper begins with a discussion of subjectivity in risk assessment and risk management and how that is partly a reflection of subjectivity more generally in the sciences. It finishes the first part suggesting that we are taught a simplistic control of subjectivity and that we have in too many instances thought that statistical tests, etc., are automatic controls for subjectivity. In Part 2, I discuss how subjectivity is a necessary part of decision-making under uncertainty and quality risk management. Experts are consulted to provide estimates of probabilities for parameters, scenarios and the likely consequences. I end with an introduction to multicriteria decision analysis as an approach for structuring complex decisions under uncertainty, both for our daily lives and for team decision making in our organisations.   

summary: Subjectivity is a necessary part of decision-making under uncertainty and quality risk management. Nevertheless, subjectivity can be controlled through the use of more objectively-based tools of multicriteria decision analysis.
